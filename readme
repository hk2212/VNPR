Built a project aimed at automatic detection and extraction of vehicle license plate information from images or
video streams captured by cameras.
 Implemented advanced image preprocessing, object detection, and character recognition algorithms to achieve a
high level of accuracy in identifying and reading license plates in various lighting and environmental conditions
 Utilized computer vision techniques to accurately and efficiently extract and interpret license plate information.
